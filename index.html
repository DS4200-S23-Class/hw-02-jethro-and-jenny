                    <br>High-level task: 
                        <li>Consume --> Present: All of the points representing the daily maximum temperatures from 1979 to 2021 are laid out in such a way that suggests the creator wants to communicate a specific message to the audience. The title suggests that the visualization is meant to display the daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1979 to 2021. Furthermore, the placement and style of the graph's red points highlight that the visualization creators wanted to emphasize the temperatures in the last 3 days from the visualization's publication date , which were higher than normal. The content in this visualization has already been predetermined and is not providing any new facts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Medium-level task: 
                        <li>Search --> Lookup: The fact that three of the points are red and annotated suggests that they are meant to draw a user's attention and thus are the targets of the visualization. Hence, the target is known because those three red points must be observed for the user to extract the chart's message most effectively. The target points stress any deviations in the typical daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1979 to 2021. The location of the targets is simple to find: the user would just have to pinpoint the three bold red points. With both the location and target known, lookup seems to be the medium-level task for this visualization.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Low-level task: 
                        <li>Query --> Compare: The visualization's creator emphasized the temperatures of the last three days by making them red and labeling them, causing users to be automatically drawn to those points. The emphasis also makes it seem like the creator wanted users to compare those specific values to others. Those three points are highlighted with an annotation to emphasize the maximum daily temperature in Vancouver in the last 3 days from when the visualization was made. Furthermore, the plot conveys the daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1979 to 2021. Between those points and the three red ones mentioned before, multiple comparisons can be made with this visualization. These comparisons include seeing how the maximum temperatures differed in the last 3 days from when the visualization was made compared to the maximum temperatures on the same days in previous years, and the fluctuations in the daily maximum temperatures each month from January to December.</li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>Targets:  
                    <li>All Data --> Outliers: The visualization draws attention to the daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver in merely the last 3 days from the visualization's publication day compared to all other days in 1979-2021. This strategy is accomplished by how the points representing the last 3 days are red and labeled while the others are gray, smaller, and lack annotations. The three red points indicate that Vancouver experienced abnormally higher temperatures during those days in June, as they are located significantly above the cluster of gray points that align neatly together to form a hump. Hence, the three red points are outliers that represent data of interest to the user.</li>

                    <br>High-level task: 
                        <li>Consume --> Present: All of the data collected is displayed across two visualizations. It does not seem like the visualizations/data will be used to produce something else. Furthermore, this data visualization contains information already known (temperature data collected in the past) and hence would not enable one to discover something completely new. The information being presented is, as suggested by the plot's title, the number of times the daily average temperatures were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal (based on the 1950-90 averages) from 1990 to 2021 in Seattle and Portland.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Medium-level task: 
                        <li>Search --> Browse: The target is unknown because it is unclear what the user is meant to look for. They could be analyzing the overall trends shown by both plots, comparing data between the two cities during a particular set of years, etc. The visualization does not contain a specific purpose and lends itself to a lot of conclusions. Nevertheless, the locations of indicators that could help answer a user's questions are clearly depicted. Times when each city experienced unusually high temperature conditions are glaringly represented as red blocks. Each sub-chart is also labeled with the city (Seattle or Portland) they contain data for, and those labels mark the locations of possible data of interest. Therefore, one can easily use the squares and labels as reference points to look up the data they wish to browse from the visualization. </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Low-level task: 
                        <li>Query --> Compare: The two visualizations share the same styling elements. For instance, the years are placed at the same locations on their x axes and the red boxes used in each are of the same shade and height. This formatting style can be interpreted as the creator guiding the user to compare the data from both cities to each other. If each plot's aesthetic vastly contrasted from each other, it would be less intuitive for an individual to ponder the similarities and differences between the message each conveys. One can compare the locations of the red boxes in the Seattle plot to those in the Portland one to compare each city's experiences with abnormal temperatures. For instance, one can see that Portland experienced more daily mean temperatures that were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal between 2000 and 2010 than Seattle.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Targets:  
                        <li>Attributes --> Many --> Similarity: Users are looking at two datasets, which contain the same type of data but for different cities, that are placed side by side. Thus, the visualization is probably meant for users to compare when and the number of times the daily mean temperatures were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Seattle compared to when and that in Portland.</li>
                        <li>(Alternative target) All Data --> Trends: The visualization displays all of the data collected thus far since 1990. The two plots communicate that both cities have experienced a stark increase in recent years in days when the mean temperatures were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. The visualization strengthens that claim by displaying a concerning unevenly higher placement of red bars closer to the right of both plots than to the left. Hence, the visualization displays a trend in which Seattle and Portland have been experiencing more abnormally high temperatures in recent years.</li>
