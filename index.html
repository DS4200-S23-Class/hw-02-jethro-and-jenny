                    <br>High-level task: 
                        <li>Consume --> Present: All of the daily maximum temperatures from 1979 - 2021 are laid out in such a way that suggests the creator wants to communicate a message. The title suggests that the visualization is meant to convey the daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1970 to 2021. Furthermore, the placement of the red points on the graph highlight that the visualization creators want to show that the temperature in the last 3 days from when the visualization was created was higher than normal. Hence, the content in this visualization has already been pre-determined and not providing anything new. There also appears to be no visualization that is intended to be stemmed from this one.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Medium-level task: 
                        <li>Search --> Browse: The locations of points representing certain temperatures is made known by the y-axis, and the locations of points symbolizing particular months is guided by the x-axis. Yet, the target is unknown because there are many points on the visualization the user can observe that all have crucial roles in making the chart effective. For instance, one can be interested in the range of daily maximum temperatures in October, in which they would locate the points that correspond to October on the x axis. Conversely, someone just might be interested in any deviations in the typical daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1979 to 2021, in which they would pinpoint the three red points. </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Low-level task: 
                        <li>Query --> Compare: The creator emphasized the temperatures of the last three days by making them red and labeling them, which makes it seem like they want users to compare those values to the others. Those three points are highlighted with an annotation to emphasize the maximum daily temperature in Vancouver in the last 3 days from when the visualization was made. Furthermore, the plot conveys the daily maximum temperatures in Vancouver from 1970 to 2021. Hence, multiple comparisons can be made with this visualization, such as seeing how the temperature differed in the last 3 days from when the visualization was made compared to the temperature on the same day in previous years, and the monthly fluctuations in the daily maximum temperature from January to December.</li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>Targets:  
                    <li>All Data -> Outliers: The visualization draws attention to the daily maximum temperatues in Vancouver in merely the last 3 days compared to all other days in 1979-2021. This strategy is accomplished by how the points representing the last 3 days are red while the others are gray. The three red points indicate that Vancouver experienced abormally higher temperatures during those days in June, as they are located significantly above the cluster of gray points that align neatly together to form a hump. Hence, the three red points are outliers that represent data of interest to the user.</li>

                    <br>High-level task: 
                        <li>Consume --> Present: All the data collected is being displayed across two visualizations. It does not seem like the visualizations/data will be used to produce something else. Furthermore, this data >visualization contains information already known and hence would not enable one to discover something completely new. The information being presented is, as suggested by the plot's title, the number of times the daily average temperatures were over 20 degrees above normal from 1900 to 2021 in Seattle and Portland.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Medium-level task: 
                        <li>Search --> Lookup: The title of the plot suggests that the targets of the visualization are indicators of when the daily mean temperature was 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Seattle and Portland. The locations of these indicators are clearly depicted in the chart as stacked blocks that provide the years in which each city experienced the aforementioned temperature conditions. Therefore, one can easily use these bars as reference points to look up the data meant to be highlighted by the visualization. </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Low-level task: 
                        <li>Query --> Compare: There are two visualizations within this image, both with the same axis. The two visualizations share the same styling elements: the years are placed at the same locations on their x axes, and the red boxes used are of the same shade and height. This formatting style can be interpreted as the creator wanting the user to compare the data from both cities to each other. One can compare the location of the red boxes for the Seattle plot to those of Portland to compare each city's experiences with abnormal temperatures. For instance, one can see that Portland experienced more daily mean temperatures that were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal between 2000 and 2010 than Seattle.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>Targets:  
                        <li>Attributes --> Many --> Similarity: Users are looking at two datasets, which contain the same type of data but for different cities, side by side. Thus, the visualization is probably meant for users to compare the number of times the daily mean temperature were 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Seattle compared to that in Portland.</li>
                        <li>(Alternative target) All Data --> Trends: The visualization displays all of the data collected thus far since 1990. The two plots communicate that both cities have experienced a stark increase in days when the mean temperature was 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in recent years. The visualization is suited for that purpose by displaying a concerning unevenly higher placement of red bars closer to the right of the plots than the left. Hence, the visualization displays a trend that Seattle and Portland have been experiencing more abormally high temperatures in recent years.</li>
